# Word clock v2 frame

Included:
* FreeCAD file
* DXF files for laser-cutting
    * `backplates_lasercut_v02.dxf` the main plates of the clock
        * The last backplate should not be cut through, just marked, to more easily place the LED Strips
    * `rim.dxf` Rim on the back to hide the electronics (has to be lasercut twice for a thicker rim)
        * These can be postprocessed to 1) fit the USB-C port if you like that option 2) create a notch in one of the plates to hang the clock
    * `USB_connector.dxf` parts to build a usbc socket
        * In hindsight, I would enlarge 4 of the five holes for the plug to make it easier to fit a soldered connector

Notes:
* Currently uses M6 bolts, I would recommend using smaller ones like m3
